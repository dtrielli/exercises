A Twitter feed has a user name, user Twitter handle, date and time of post, number of likes, number of retweets and the actual content of the tweet. It would be possible, then to create a database of what people say, how and when they say it and how it is received by social media. That opens many possibilities, including in political reporting. What is Donald Trump's (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump) social media strategy compared to Bernie Sanders (https://twitter.com/berniesanders), for instance? We can compared words used, and, with that, issues being talked about. We can compare mentions in Tweets – which candidate engages more with voters or opponents? We can see what kind of message resonates more with followers.
